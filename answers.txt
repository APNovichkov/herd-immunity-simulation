What were the inputs you gave the simulation? (Population size, percent vaccinated, virus name, mortality rate, reproductive rate)
Population size: 100
Percent vaccinated: 0.1
Virus name: Smallpox
Mortality rate: 0.5
Reproductive rate: 0.5

What percentage of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out?
Total infected by virus: 90
Percent infected by virus: 90.0%

What percentage of the population died from the virus?
Total deaths from virus: 43
Percent of people that died from virus: 43.0%

Out of all interactions sick individuals had during the entire simulation, how many total interactions did we see where a vaccination saved a person from potentially becoming infected?
Total interactions where a person was saved by vaccination: 47
Percent of interactions where a person was saved by vaccination: 47.0%
